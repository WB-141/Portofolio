              Being a cat parent means embracing quiet companionship, daily
              curiosity, and those unexpected moments of affection that only a
              feline can give. It teaches patience, builds routines, and fills
              your life with calm joy, from gentle purring to spontaneous
              zoomies. There's something special about earning a cat’s trust
              because it’s not given easily and that makes it even more
              meaningful.</span

            <span class="skill-explain"
              >I like to think of myself as a pretty good cook. I don’t always
              follow recipes to the letter. Sometimes I improvise, sometimes it
              works, and sometimes it’s a learning experience. Cooking for me is
              part creativity, part chaos, and part cleaning up a bigger mess
              than I intended. But there’s something really satisfying about
              bringing ingredients together and making something people actually
              enjoy, even if I still occasionally burn the toast.</span

              >I like to think I’m great at CrossFit. Honestly, I doubt it most
              days. I show up, I sweat, and I do my best to keep up without
              tripping over a kettlebell. Some workouts feel like I'm thriving,
              others feel like survival. But there’s something addictive about
              pushing your limits alongside a bunch of other exhausted people
              who also pretend they know what they’re doing. And even if I’m not
              the strongest in the room, I’m definitely the most committed to
              pretending I enjoy burpees.</span

            <span class="skill-explain"
              >For me, coding is just another form of creativity, where logic
              meets imagination. I started by experimenting with Python and C#,
              building small games and automating random tasks just for the fun
              of it. Every line of code felt like crafting a little puzzle. Now
              with web development, I get to bring those ideas to life visually.
              Whether I’m designing clean interfaces or making silly scripts,
              I’m most at home when I’m building something from scratch that
              didn’t exist a few hours ago, and learning something new in the
              process.</span
